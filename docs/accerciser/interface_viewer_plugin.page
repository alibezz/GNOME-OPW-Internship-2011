  <title>Interface Viewer Plugin</title>

  <p>
    The Interface Viewer Plugin shows the information and controls provided by the AT-SPI interfaces
    present in each accessible item from the <link xref="desktop_tree_view">Tree View</link>. After
    selecting an item, you can use this plugin to quickly review its supported interfaces, to retrieve 
    each interface's information, and to manipulate the item through all interfaceâ€™s methods.
  </p>

      Given a selected item in the Tree View, all of its AT-SPI interfaces will be shown as sensitive
      in the Interface Viewer Plugin. Those unsupported will appear grayed out.

    In the figure above, an item with role "menu" was selected. By default, the Interface Viewer Plugin shows the
    item's role and its name - since the one in the example doesn't have a name, it won't appear. After that, all
    AT-SPI interfaces covered by the plugin appear listed. The ones provided by the item are "Accessible", "Action", 
    "Component", "Selection", and "Text". In the figure, the first three were explored, allowing interaction with 
    the "click" action provided by the item ("Action") and access to some of its information, such as number of children 
    ("Accessible") and absolute position in the desktop ("Component").

  <p>
    Exploring the Interface Viewer Plugin is very useful to learn about AT-SPI interfaces. To read more about it, you
    can either consult the <link href="http://developer.gnome.org/at-spi-cspi/stable/">AT-SPI C Bindings Reference Manual</link>
    or the <link href="http://developer.gnome.org/libatspi/2.1/">libatspi Reference Manual</link>.

     <title>Running the Interface Viewer Plugin</title>
     <p>
       The first step to run the Interface Viewer Plugin is to select an item in the <link xref="desktop_tree_view">
       Tree View</link>. After that, its implemented interfaces will automatically appear as sensitive in the plugin's
       panel. Click each one of these interfaces to either retrieve their provided information or to interact with 
       available methods.
