  <title> Event Monitor Plugin</title>
  <p>
    The Event Monitor Plugin allows you to view 
    <link href="http://accessibility.linuxfoundation.org/a11yspecs/atspi/adoc/atspi-events.html">AT-SPI events</link>
    (PENDING change link to something more reliable) 
    as they occur on the applications exposed in <app>Accerciser</app>'s
    <link xref="desktop_tree_view">Tree View</link>. The plugin is useful to explore the dynamics of an 
    application's interface and verify which accessible widgets are related to which AT-SPI events.

    <title>Running the Event Monitor Plugin</title>
    <p>
      When you open the Event Monitor Plugin, you see a list of checkboxes
      representing all the different AT-SPI event classes covered by the
      plugin, such as mouse and window. If you check a class,
      all of its event types will be monitored by the plugin. The classes
      are exposed as tree structures; therefore, you can refine your selection
      expanding them and checking only the event types you really care about.
    </p>
    <p>  
      If you want to monitor all possible types of AT-SPI events, press the <cmd>Select All</cmd>
      button. Analogously, if you want to clear all currently selected event types,
      press the <cmd>Clear Selection</cmd> button.
    </p>

    <note style="tip">
      <p>
        Selecting only a few event types per monitoring gives you a clearer output. 
      </p>
    </note>
    <p>  
      Besides selecting event types to be monitored, you can specify the context of the
      Event Monitor Plugin. By default, the Source option <cmd>Everything</cmd> is selected,
      indicating that AT-SPI events of all applications in the Tree View will be monitored.
      If you want to investigate a single application, select it
      in the Tree View and click the Source option <cmd>Selected application</cmd>. Analogously,
      if you want to monitor a single accessible widget and its corresponding descendants,
      select it in the Tree View and click the Source option <cmd>Selected accessible</cmd>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After selecting event types and specifying a Source option, the Event Monitor Plugin starts
      monitoring AT-SPI events automatically, because the <cmd>Monitor Events</cmd> button is
      pressed by default. Whenever you want to stop monitoring, click the <cmd>Monitor Events</cmd>
      button. To restart monitoring, press this button again.

    <p>
      For each monitored event, the Event Monitor Plugin indicates its related source - i.e., the accessible
      widget directly associated with the event - and application. Double-clicking the indicated source will
      select it in the Tree View and highlight it in the corresponding application. 
      Double-clicking the indicated application will simply select it in the Tree View.    
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to save the output generated by the Event Monitor Plugin in your system,
      just press the <cmd>Save</cmd> button. To clear the output screen, you just need to
      click the <cmd>Clear</cmd> button.
