  <title>Tree View</title>

  <p>
    <app>Accerciser</app>'s interface contains a Tree View that covers all accessible applications
    currently running on the desktop. To create the Tree View, <app>Accerciser</app> first 
    uses the AT-SPI's registry daemon to get all accessible applications that
    are currently running on the desktop. This daemon is responsible for keeping track of all the
    accessible applications on the desktop and forwarding X events over the AT-SPI D-Bus. 
  </p>
  <p>
    After getting all accessible applications, <app>Accerciser</app> represents each one of them
    as a tree with expanding nodes.

  <p>
    The first node of each tree represented in the Tree View is the application itself. When you expand a node, you
    can see all of its children widgets, which allows a hierarchical view of the application's interface. For each node in
    the Tree View, <app>Accerciser</app> provides some basic information, such as its name, role and number of 
    children. 
  </p>
  <note style="caution">
    <p>
      Be aware that nodes with many children take a long time to expand.
