  <title>What is <app>Accerciser</app>?</title>
  <p>
    <app>Accerciser</app> is an interactive Python accessibility explorer.
    It uses the AT-SPI library to inspect, examine, and interact with widgets, allowing
    you to check if an application is providing correct information to assistive
    technologies and automated testing frameworks. <app>Accerciser</app> comes with a set
    of plugins that you can use to create custom views of accessibility 
    information.  
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, <app>Accerciser</app>'s main interface is composed by three sections:
    a tree view of the entire desktop accessible hierarchy and two plugin areas.
    If you prefer to see all plugins in a single area, dividing <app>Accerciser</app>'s
    interface in two sections instead of three, type <key>ctrl</key>+<key>t</key>. To
    re-divide it in three sections, just press <key>ctrl</key>+<key>t</key> again.
  </p>

    <title><app>Accerciser</app>'s intended audience</title>
    <p>
      <app>Accerciser</app> fits the needs of many different audiences. It can be used by user interface
      developers as a means of ensuring that their applications are providing all of their features
      through AT-SPI. The <link xref="validator_plugin">AT-SPI Validator Plugin</link> is useful for that.
      Also, it can be used by assistive technology developers
      to see what AT-SPI is providing to their applications. Automated UI test
      developers are also benefited by <app>Accerciser</app>, since it exposes different events
      that could be expected from their target application. <app>Accerciser</app> default plugins,
      such as the Interface Viewer Plugin (PENDING section) and the <link xref="event_monitor_plugin">
      Event Monitor Plugin</link>, are useful in both cases.

    <p>
      <app>Accerciser</app> has an extensible, plugin-based architecture.
      It has a fairly small core and most of its features are part of its
      default plugins:

    <title>More about Accessibility</title>
    <p>
       Accessibility is a core value that should touch all aspects of a Desktop
       Environment. To help achieving it in GNOME, some libraries were developed,
       such as ATK and AT-SPI. Though originated in GNOME, these libraries are now
       also used in other Desktop Environments. To learn more about Accessibility
       Libraries for GNU/UNIX systems, you can consult:

          <link href="http://developer.gnome.org/atk/">ATK Accessibility Toolkit</link>
          ATK provides the set of accessibility interfaces that are implemented by other toolkits and applications.
          Using the ATK interfaces, accessibility tools have full access to view and control running applications.

          AT-SPI is the primary service interface by which assistive technologies query and receive 
          notifications from running applications. Additional material is available from the
