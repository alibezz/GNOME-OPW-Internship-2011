  <title>What is <app>Accerciser</app>?</title>
  <p>
    <app>Accerciser</app> is an interactive Python accessibility explorer.
    It uses AT-SPI to inspect, examine, and interact with widgets, allowing
    you to check if an application is providing correct information to assistive
    technologies and automated testing frameworks. Accerciser comes with a set
    of plugins which you can use to create custom views of accessibility 
    information.

    <title><app>Accerciser</app>'s intended audience</title>
    <p>
      Accerciser fits the needs of many different audiences. It can be used by user interface
      developers as a means to ensure that their application is providing all of its features
      through AT-SPI. The <app>Accerciser</app> default validator plugin is useful for that (PENDING
      put a link to validator section). Also, it can be used by assistive technology developers
      to see what AT-SPI is providing to their applications. Automated UI test
      developers are also benefited by <app>Accerciser</app>, since it exposes different events
      that could be expected from their target application. <app>Accerciser</app> default plugins,
      such as the interface viewer and the event monitor, are useful for both of latter cases.
